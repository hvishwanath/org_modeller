# What is it?

Modelling teams and organizations rapidly should be as simple as editing text based files. This tool supports a custom yaml model to specify [organizational structures and hierarchies](data/sample/sample.yaml) and produces [markdown report](data/sample/output.md) complete with table of contents. I found it useful in analyzing my own orgs for structure, seniority, coverage, geo/leve/gender splits.

Built with python and [`igraph`](https://python.igraph.org/en/main/).
